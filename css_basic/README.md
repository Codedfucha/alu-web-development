This project is part of the ALU Web Development curriculum. It focuses on basic HTML and CSS, applying styling to a simple website using only internal HTML and external CSS without any external libraries.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main page of the website.
- **tweets.html**: A page that contains an embedded tweet.
- **base.css**: Contains general, reusable CSS rules across the website.
- **styles.css**: Contains custom CSS rules specific to the website.

## Features

3. **Responsive Design**: The website adjusts to different screen sizes.
4. **No External Libraries**: The project adheres strictly to the use of HTML and CSS without any external libraries like Bootstrap or JavaScript frameworks.
